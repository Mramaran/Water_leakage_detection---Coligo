AI-Driven Smart Water Management System (COLIGO)

This project presents an AI-powered water management platform designed for smart cities to optimize and sustain urban water usage. The solution addresses pressing challenges including population growth, climate change, and the limitations of outdated infrastructure. Traditional methods are often reactive and inefficient; this system provides real-time adaptability and predictive insights for proactive management.

Key Features:

IoT sensors: Real-time monitoring of flow, pressure, temperature, turbidity, and pH across water networks.

Machine Learning models: Forecasting water demand, detecting leaks and anomalies, and monitoring water quality.

GIS Integration: Geospatial visualization for improved spatial awareness and water log detection.

Edge and Cloud Computing: Combines low-latency local AI processing (e.g., on Raspberry Pi) with deep cloud analytics using platforms like AWS IoT.

User Dashboards: Intuitive interfaces powered by Power BI and COLIGO Edge AIoT Software for actionable insights and decision support.

Technologies Used:

LSTM networks, autoencoders, anomaly detection, predictive analytics

Edge deployment for fast response

Cloud APIs for integration with dashboards

Streaming learning technology for live data training and inference

Expected Benefits:

Up to 30% reduction in water loss due to leaks

Faster, data-driven emergency response

Sustainable consumption and infrastructure planning

Enhanced citizen engagement through accessible monitoring systems
